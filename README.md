**Vantage** is a high-performance Single Page Application (SPA) built with vanilla **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**. It demonstrates high-fidelity UI implementation without the overhead of heavy frameworks.

* **Zero-Dependency:** No React, Vue, or external libraries. Just pure, performant code (< 20kb).
* **Local Persistence:** Utilizes the browser's `localStorage` API for a persistent, client-side JSON database.
* **Responsive Architecture:** Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox with media queries to deliver two distinct UX layouts (Mobile Feed vs. Desktop Dashboard) from a single codebase.
* **State Management:** Custom vanilla JS state handling for real-time UI updates and reactive DOM manipulation.
